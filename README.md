# SRI Generic Query Specification

## Introduction

To allow filtering on list resources, [SRI][sri] describes the server should implement a set of URL parameters, to allow the client to restrict the list of items retrieved. Besides stating that a number of sensible data access paths should be supported, it does not give any specifics. This specification describes a standard filtering method, that standardizes basic filtering. It allows the list resource to be restricted on any of the direct keys in the resource, and allows the client to apply operators to it's value. These basic filters take this form :

    [key][prefix-1][prefix-2][operator]=[value]

For example, to restrict the list resource to only include items where publication date is before 1/1/2015 :

    GET /items?issuedBefore=2015-01-01T00:00:00Z

In this example *key* is `issued`, *operator* is `Before`, and *value* is `2015-01-01`, and `prefix` is omitted.

The basic filters SHOULD BE applicable to any direct key of these types :

* `string`
* `timestamp` The *value* should be a timestamp as specified in [RFC3339][rfc3339]. The *value* may ommit the time portion.
* `numeric`
* `array` The *value* should contain a comma-separated list of one of the above 3 types

Operators are case insensitive, by default. The supported *operator* values are :

* If no *operator* is specified (i.e. GET /items?publicationDate=2015-01-01T00:00:00+02:00). 
  * For `strings` only resources that have a case insensitive match SHOULD BE selected.
  * For `numeric` and `timestamp` only resources that have this exact value SHOULD BE selected.
  * For `array` all resources MUST BE selected where the array in the resource is the same as the array that corresponds to `value`.

* `Greater`
  * For `string`, this does a case insensitive comparison, and selects resources that have a string [key] with sort order greater than [value]
  * For `timestamp` and `numeric`, it selects items that have *key* > *value*

* `GreaterOrEqual`, `After`
  * For `string`, this does a case insensitive comparison, and selects resources that have [key] with sort order greater than, or equal to [value].
  * For `timestamp` and `numeric`, it selects resources that have *key* >= *value*

* `Less`
  * For `string`, this does a case insensitive comparison, and selects resources that have *key* with sort order less than *value*
  * For `timestamp` and `numeric`, it selects resources that have *key* < *value*

* `LessOrEqual`, `Before`
  * For `string`, this does a case insensitive comparison, and selects resources that have *key* with sort order less than, or equal to *value*
  * For `timestamp` and `numeric`, it selects resources that have *key* <= *value*

* `In` : Selects resources where *key* (string, numeric or timestamp) is any of *value*. Where *value* is a comma-separated list of items.

* `Contains`
  * For `string`, selects resources that contains (case insensive) a substring *value*
  * For `array`, it returns resources where the resource has an array that contains the sub-array (possibly a single value) that is formed by *value* (being a comma-separated list of strings, numerics, or timestamps).
  * For `DCMI-Period` values, it returns those resources where [value] (an RFC3339 timestamp) is between *start* and *end* (inclusive).

* `RegEx`
  * For `string`, selects resource that match (case insensitive) a POSIX regular expression *value*.

Any of the *operators* (including the equality operator that is blank) above can be extended with `CaseSensitive` as a *prefix*, this changes their behaviour to be case sensitive.

On top of the operator *prefix* `CaseSensitive`, all operator can have a second *prefix* `Not`, to invert the operatorâ€™s logic.

Examples : 

    GET /items?firstNameCaseSensitiveNotContains=ike
    GET /items?firstName=mike
    GET /items?firstNameNot=mike
    GET /items?firstNameCaseSensitive=Mike
    GET /items?publicationDateBefore=2015-01-10
    GET /items?publicationDateContains=2015-04-01
    GET /items?tagsContains=news
    GET /transactions?amountLessEqual=0
    GET /transactions?amountGreater=100000

Besides the general filters above it is advised that servers implemented a simple full-text search. They should do this by implementing a parameter `q`. The value of the parameter can have multiple keywords, separated by a plus (+) sign.

For example :

    http://api.vsko.be/persons?q=Mieke+Heck

Searching through this `q` parameter should by definition be a broad search. So at least case-insensitive matches on sub-strings should be supported. Typically this list resource will be used to provide auto-completion in a user interface, so speed is very important. 

Specifying a criterium (key + operator) more than once results in all operations being applied in additive (AND) fashion.
